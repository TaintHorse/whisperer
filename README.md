# What is this?

It's an IRC-like interface for XMPP Multi-User-Conferences (eg: chat rooms),
back-ended by the lovely, [node-xmpp](https://npmjs.org/package/node-xmpp).

It roughly implements XMPP's [IRC command mapping](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html#impl-client-irc)

## Usage

``` javascript
var Whisperer = require('whisperer')
  , client = new Whisperer({
      jid: 'bob@example.jabber.server.com'
      password: 'your password here'
    })

client.join({ jid: 'example@conference.jabber.org', nick: 'example' })
client.on('message', function(message) {
  console.log(message.from + ': ' + message.body)
})
```
